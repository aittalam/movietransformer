# movietransformer

A small experiment training a transformer to translate moviewarez filenames into actual movie titles. Still far from being complete, but hopefully a nice project to play with!

Strongly based on the [Neural machine translation with a Transformer and Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/transformer) tutorial.

Many thanks to [OpenSubtitles](https://opensubtitles.org) for sharing their data!
